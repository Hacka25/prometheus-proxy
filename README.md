**README.md: Prometheus Proxy**

Welcome to the Prometheus Proxy project! This repository contains the source code and configuration files for a proxy server that handles gRPC communication between clients and servers.

**Overview**
----------

The Prometheus Proxy is a reverse proxy designed to handle high-traffic, low-latency connections. It's built using Kotlin, gRPC, and other libraries to provide a scalable and secure solution for your applications.

**Key Components**

* **Kotlin Code Style**: The project uses the official Kotlin code style, which ensures consistency across the codebase.
* **Settings.gradle**: This file defines the root project name as "prometheus-proxy".
* **Gradle.properties**: This file contains configuration properties for the Gradle build tool, including settings for Kotlin, gRPC, and other dependencies.
* **Agent**: The Agent class manages and monitors agent aspects, such as configuration and logging.
* **Admin**: The Admin class provides administrative features, such as setting up proxy rules and monitoring metrics.
* **Grpc**: The Grpc class handles gRPC communication between clients and servers.
* **Http**: The Http class enables HTTP access to the proxy server.
* **Internal**: The Internal class manages internal processes, such as caching and logging.

**Installation and Running**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/prometheus-proxy.git`
2. Install Gradle: `gradle wrapper` (this will download and install Gradle)
3. Run the proxy server: `./gradlew run`

This will start the proxy server, which will listen on port 50440.

**Configuration**

The project uses various configuration files to control its behavior. You can modify these files to suit your needs:

* **gradle.properties**: This file contains settings for Kotlin, gRPC, and other dependencies.
* **settings.gradle**: This file defines the root project name as "prometheus-proxy".
* **application.conf**: This file contains application-level configuration settings.

**Special Features**

The Prometheus Proxy includes several special features to help you manage your proxy server:

* **Metrics**: The Metrics class collects and reports metrics, such as request latency and error rates.
* **Logging**: The Logging class provides logging capabilities for the proxy server.
